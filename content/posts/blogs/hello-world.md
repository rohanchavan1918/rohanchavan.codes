# `# ./hello-world`

Hey folks! Welcome to my tech blog, where we're kicking things off with a warm "Hello World"! It's not just a title; it's an invitation to join me on an exciting journey through the world of engineering, innovation, and more.

In this post, we're diving into my experiences with Python, Golang, infosec, hackathons, personal projects, microservices, and system designs. But this isn't just a one-way street , feel free to hit me up and let's get this conversation started!

Here's to new connections, shared knowledge, and plenty of "ooh,I didnt knew that (^\_^)" moments along the way!

Can't wait to hear from you,

Rohan
