That\u0026rsquo;s why I\u0026rsquo;m diving into Go Generics now, starting with a hands-on project: building a Scheduler service capable of handling scheduled tasks like making HTTP calls etc (Lets keep is simple as of now ). This project is also a chance for me to try out new packages and follow test driven development.\nBut why a scheduler ? theres lot of options already. #\rI have been using services like Pipedream to create journeys/automations which helps me to schedule HTTP calls, and it works absolutely fine. What I miss in it is the ability to schedule a skip for any automation, for example I wish that my scheduled curl call could be skipped every alternate saturday, or maybe skip the automation on a particular date. Last but not the least, free trial is going to expire soon, and I would prefer to pay $XX for my own ec2 which I could use for many other things insted of just one service.\nBelow are the features that I wanted my scheduler to have:\nConfigure HTTP calls to be scheduled to run every n seconds/minutes/hours/days/weeks/months/year. Configure using crontab. Configure skipping of schedule on particular conditions. Configure same http call to multiple endpoints. Configure retries on particular status code responses. Configure alerts on success/failure etc. Mapping Out the Project: Libraries and Approaches #\rNow that I have decided what to build, lets think about how. To keep things simple I am going to use DuckDB ,I had my eye on it for a while but didnt get a chance to use it. Ideally I would use Viper for config management but since this is about exploration, I have decided to give a shot to Koanf which is much more light weight then Viper.\nPredefined cron expressions (Copied from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#Predefined_scheduling_definitions, with text modified according to this implementation)\nEntry Description Equivalent to @annually Run once a year at midnight in the morning of January 1 0 0 0 1 1 \\* _ @yearly Run once a year at midnight in the morning of January 1 0 0 0 1 1 _ _ @monthly Run once a month at midnight in the morning of the first of the month 0 0 0 1 _ \\* _ @weekly Run once a week at midnight in the morning of Sunday 0 0 0 _ _ 0 _ @daily Run once a day at midnight 0 0 0 \\* \\* \\* _ @hourly Run once an hour at the beginning of the hour 0 0 _ \\* \\* \\* \\* @reboot Not supported ","date":"2 April 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/blogs/exploring-go-generics/","section":"","summary":"How confident are you with Go Generics?","title":"# 1.
